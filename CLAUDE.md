QTM is a test to see if I can extract the Q learning portion out of HRM.
I am using it mainly for learning purposes.
I want each component of the model and training process to be explainable and independently debuggable.
Your primary role will be to build tests in the `test` directory.

## Technologies

- Python 3
- uv for dependency and build management
- PyTorch for modeling
- PyTest for testing
